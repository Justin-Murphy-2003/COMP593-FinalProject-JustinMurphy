-stared at project
-thought about what to do
-idk

2022-04-12
-panicked upon realizing i hadn't added anything yet
-did part of create_image_db function

2022-04-13
-i think i finished the create_image_db function, but now i feel overwhelmed from overthinking it
-did some other work

2022-04-14
-got a better understanding of things
-felt like i understood universe
-finished create_image_db function AND get_apod_info function
-i think this was a productive day

2022-04-15
-get_apod_info works now
-it didn't work before

2022-04-25
-started download_apod_image
-idk how to do download_apod_image

2022-04-26
-i think download_apod_image works now
-tried doing get_image_path
-coding is hard sometimes

2022-04-27
-got an answer about a question i had for get-image-path
-thanks Jeremy
-get_image_path works now
-did image_sha256 previously, just realized i still need to find image_size
-found image_size using len(), like a boss
-also did print_apod_info, like a boss
-fixed create_image_db so it has the appropriate number of columns

2022-04-28
-after lots of panic and chaos, script almost done
-once again, thanks Jeremy, i wouldn't've figured out the reason my variables looked wrong if it weren't for your support as instructor of COMP 593
-fixed image_url so it returns a link to the image instead of to the site itself as it did previously (i thought something looked weird)
-image_size makes sense now that image_url
-image_sha256 properly returns the actual SHA-256 value and not whatever it returned previously
-after asking about some problems, image_already_in_db, save_image_file, and add_image_to_db work as well
-set_desktop_image_background works too, which i figured out on my own (it was very easy)
-the script, after a freaking heck of a lot of testing, works

2022-04-29
-just to be absolutely sure it works, i ran the script again
-it does in fact work
-i know testing probably means nothing grade-wise, but it never hurts to be 100% sure that a script works right
